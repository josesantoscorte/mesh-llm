## SSD Expert Streaming

Run giant MoE models on a single node by streaming active experts from NVMe instead of fitting everything in RAM. Trunk (attention, norms, embeddings) stays resident; expert weights live on disk, `pread()`'d on demand per token.

[flash-moe](https://github.com/danveloper/flash-moe) already does this. From-scratch C/Metal engine, runs Qwen3.5-397B-A17B (120GB 2-bit experts) at 5.5 tok/s on a 48GB M3 Max. 6GB resident memory. Complete working inference engine — 7K lines of C/ObjC/Metal. See also [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md).

**Plan:** Use flash-moe directly as an alternative backend. Mesh-llm spawns it like it spawns llama-server — process management, HTTP/SSE wrapper, kill on shutdown. Don't try to hack SSD streaming into llama.cpp; the `ggml_mul_mat_id` op assumes all expert weights are resident in one contiguous tensor per layer. Changing that is deep surgery across ggml, the Metal backend, and the model loader. Not worth it when a working engine exists.

**Limitation:** flash-moe only supports Qwen3.5-397B (GatedDeltaNet + full attention, 512 experts, hardcoded architecture). That's the model we want to run. More models = more forward pass implementations.

**What flash-moe needs to integrate:**
- HTTP/SSE endpoint (currently interactive CLI only — `chat.m`)
- OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` so mesh-llm's proxy can route to it
- Model weight prep: `repack_experts.py` to convert safetensors → packed per-layer binary files

**Key findings from flash-moe (don't repeat their mistakes):**
- Trust the OS page cache — every custom cache made it worse. Deleting the cache was a 38% speedup.
- `pread()` >> `mmap()` for expert loading (5×). mmap = 240 page faults per 3.9MB expert.
- 2-bit expert quant preserves quality (RMSE ~0.001). 44% smaller, biggest throughput win.
- Kernel I/O hints (F_RDADVISE, MADV_RANDOM, etc.) useless or harmful on Apple Silicon.
- Speculative routing doesn't work — 65-80% wrong predictions, wastes bandwidth.

- [ ] **Phase 6: scale testing** — Mixtral 8×22B, Qwen3-235B-A22B.

## Peer-to-Peer Model Transfer

Fetch model files directly from mesh peers instead of HuggingFace. Peers already have QUIC connections — add a new stream type (`STREAM_FILE_TRANSFER`) where the requester sends a filename and offset, the responder streams the file back.

**Why:** LAN transfers are massively faster than HuggingFace downloads. Two machines on the same network could transfer a 47GB model in minutes instead of an hour. Also works when HF is slow, rate-limited, or down.

**Design:**
- New bi-stream type in `dispatch_streams`: requester sends filename + resume offset, responder reads from `~/.models/` and streams back
- Only serve files from `~/.models/` — no path traversal
- Resume support: send byte offset, responder seeks to that position
- Prefer low-RTT peers (LAN) over high-RTT (relay) for transfer source
- Download logic tries peers first, falls back to HuggingFace
- `available_models` gossip already exists — extend it to include filenames on disk so peers know what's fetchable

**Open questions:**
- Prioritize file transfer streams below inference streams? QUIC stream priorities could help
- Rate limiting to avoid saturating the link during active inference
- Multi-peer parallel download (fetch chunks from different peers)?

## Vision / Multimodal

llama.cpp already supports vision models via `--mmproj` (multimodal projector). The server handles OpenAI-compatible `image_url` content parts in `/v1/chat/completions`. Our proxy forwards request bodies as-is, so the vision message format should just work end-to-end.

**What's needed:**
- **Launch**: Pass `--mmproj <file>` when starting llama-server for vision models
- **Catalog**: Add vision models with their mmproj files (two downloads per model)
- **Router**: Detect vision requests (content array with `image_url` type), route only to vision-capable hosts

**Models (all Qwen3.5 are vision-native):**
- Qwen3.5-0.8B (~0.5GB + 0.3GB mmproj) — tiny, runs anywhere, good for OCR/screenshots
- Qwen3.5-27B (~16GB + mmproj) — Studio already has the text model on disk, just needs mmproj
- Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Qwen2.5-VL-32B, Qwen2.5-VL-72B — dedicated vision variants
- Gemma-3-12b, Pixtral-12B — alternative architectures

**Blocker: one model per host.** Currently each host runs a single llama-server. Vision as a second model needs multi-model-per-host support (see below). Without that, a host must choose between its text model and a vision model.

No image generation — llama.cpp is transformers only. Vision = understanding (describe, OCR, visual QA).

## Multi-Model Per Host

Currently each host runs one llama-server serving one model. Hosts with spare VRAM could serve multiple models simultaneously.

**Options:**
1. **Multiple llama-server processes** — each on a different port, proxy routes by model. Simple but duplicates KV cache overhead.
2. **llama-server native multi-model** — newer versions support `--model` multiple times. Single process, shared infrastructure. Need to verify this works with `--mmproj` for mixed text+vision serving.

**Why it matters:**
- Studio (206GB) could serve MiniMax (130GB) + Qwen3.5-27B-VL (20GB) + spare
- Mini (16GB) could serve Qwen3-8B (5GB) + Qwen3.5-0.8B-VL (1GB)
- Vision doesn't have to replace the text model
- Draft/speculative models could coexist with the main model

**Implications:**
- Election needs to account for multiple models per host
- Gossip announcements need to advertise multiple serving models
- Proxy routing needs model→host:port mapping (not just host)
- VRAM budget tracking per host

## Smart Router
- [ ] **Static speed estimates**: Add `tok_s: f64` to ModelProfile. Feed into scoring so Quick tasks prefer fast models.
- [ ] **Response quality checks**: Detect empty/repetitive/truncated responses, trigger retry with different model.

## Resilience
- [ ] **Multi-node tensor split recovery**: If one split peer dies, re-split across remaining.
- [ ] **`kill_llama_server()` uses `pkill -f`**: Should kill by PID, not pattern match.

## Experiments
- [ ] Qwen3.5-397B-A17B on single 128GB M4 Max (SSD streaming)
- [ ] Qwen3.5-397B-A17B across 128GB M4 Max + second machine (MoE split)
- [ ] Largest dense models across 2+ machines (Llama-3.3-70B, Qwen2.5-72B)
