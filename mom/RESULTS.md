# MoM Experiment Results

## Setup

3 models on Studio (M4 Max, 206GB):
- **Alpha**: MiniMax-M2.5-Q4_K_M (253B MoE) — strongest model
- **Beta**: Qwen3-8B-Q4_K_M — small general model  
- **Gamma**: Qwen3-30B-A3B-Q4_K_M (30B MoE, 3B active) — small MoE model

Protocol: NSED (N-Way Self-Evaluating Deliberation), up to 3 rounds.
- Parallel proposal generation from all 3 agents
- Anonymous cross-evaluation (diagonal mask — can't score own proposal)
- Quadratic voting aggregation (sqrt of scores dampens extremes)
- Winner's answer becomes context for next round

Thinking mode disabled (`enable_thinking: false`) — direct answers only.

## Results

| Test | Solo Alpha | Solo Beta | Solo Gamma | Ensemble | Rounds | Winner |
|------|-----------|----------|-----------|----------|--------|--------|
| Math | 128.3s | 12.1s | 13.9s | 191.5s | 3 | Gamma→Alpha→Gamma |
| Code | 23.1s | 6.5s | 6.3s | 123.3s | 3 | Gamma→Gamma→Gamma |
| Tool Use | 1.4s | 0.4s | 0.3s | 9.9s | 2 ✅ | Alpha→Alpha (converged) |
| Reasoning | 33.9s | 15.4s | 9.7s | 155.7s | 3 | Alpha→Gamma→Alpha |

**Agent win totals**: Alpha: 5 wins, Beta: 0 wins, Gamma: 6 wins

## Key Findings

### 1. Tool Use: Clear winner — MiniMax dominates
Alpha (MiniMax) was the ONLY model that correctly called both tools in a single response. Beta and Gamma only called `get_weather` and ignored the calculation. The ensemble correctly identified Alpha's multi-tool answer as best and converged in 2 rounds. **This is the strongest MoM result** — the ensemble picked the right specialist.

### 2. Math: All models get the same approach
All three models use the same completing-the-square method. The ensemble doesn't improve the answer — it mostly polishes presentation. MiniMax was slowest (128s) because of its size, even without thinking mode.

### 3. Code: All models produce correct O(n log n) LIS
Gamma wins every round, but the code is functionally identical across all three. The ensemble adds no value here — any solo model produces a correct `bisect_left`-based solution.

### 4. Reasoning: Genuine improvement through deliberation
The TCP vs QUIC comparison shows real improvement. Round 1 picks Alpha's detailed analysis, Round 2 Gamma refines it, Round 3 Alpha produces a more precise version that addresses peer review concerns. The final answer is notably better structured with explicit assumptions (TCP + TLS 1.3, IETF QUIC) and practical focus.

### 5. Beta (Qwen3-8B) never wins
Zero wins across all tests. It's outclassed by both MiniMax and the 30B MoE. In a MoM ensemble, weak models become pure evaluators — they add voting power but never lead.

### 6. Latency cost is high
Ensemble is 3-10x slower than the best solo model per task. Each round requires N proposals + N*(N-1) evaluations = 3 + 6 = 9 API calls. With 3 rounds: 27 API calls per query.

## Conclusions

**Does MoM work?** Partially.

✅ **Tool use**: The ensemble correctly identifies the model that fully satisfies the request. This is the most promising direction — routing to the right model via peer evaluation.

✅ **Reasoning**: Multi-round deliberation improves structure and rigor for open-ended analysis.

❌ **Math/Code**: When all models can solve the problem, the ensemble adds latency without improving correctness. The "convergent" problems don't benefit.

❌ **Latency**: 3-10x overhead is too much for interactive use. Could work for batch/background tasks.

## Implications for mesh-llm

1. **Smart routing via MoM evaluation is promising**. Instead of full deliberation loops, a single evaluation round could help pick which model's answer is best. This is essentially "try all models, vote on the best" — 1 round instead of 3.

2. **MoM for tool calls specifically**: When multiple models disagree on tool selection, cross-evaluation picks the most complete one. Could be a mesh router feature: if `auto` model and tools present, try N models in parallel, vote on winner.

3. **Don't do full NSED for simple queries**. The paper's AIME results required 6-7 rounds of 20K-token thinking models. Our practical tasks don't benefit from that depth.

4. **Model diversity matters more than model count**. MiniMax (MoE, strong tools) + Qwen3-30B (MoE, fast) complement each other. Adding a third weak model (Qwen3-8B) didn't help — it never won.

## Claude vs Qwen3-8B: Agentic Comparison

### Real agentic task (pi harness, multi-turn with tools)

Task: Add a `display_name()` method to a Rust User struct. Agent must read files, edit the right one, produce compiling code.

Ran via `pi -p` (print mode) with `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` isolation — same approach as Open Model Gym.

| | Claude Sonnet 4 | Qwen3-8B (local) |
|--|---|----|
| Time | **12s** | 84s |
| Score | **5/5** | 3/5 |
| Edited file? | ✅ Yes, correct | ❌ No |
| Compiles? | ✅ | ✅ (unchanged) |
| Hallucinated? | No | **Yes** — claimed method already existed |

**Claude** read `user.rs`, added the method in the right place with `format!("{} {}", self.first_name, self.last_name)`, preserved all existing methods. 12 seconds, clean.

**Qwen3-8B** hallucinated that the method was already present and produced no edit. The file was untouched. 84 seconds wasted on nothing.

### Single-turn comparison (raw API, no tools)

Same code review task (find bugs in a Python statistics module):

| | Claude Sonnet 4 | Qwen3-8B (local) |
|--|---|----|
| Time | 34s | 29s |
| Bugs found | 10 | 7 |
| Quality | Excellent | Good |

Claude found more subtle edge cases (NaN, infinity, booleans-as-ints, string-as-iterable). Qwen3-8B caught the main bugs but missed nuance.

### Verdict

**The gap is massive for agentic work.** Single-turn, the models are in the same ballpark — Qwen3-8B finds 70% of what Claude finds. But when you need the model to actually use tools (read files, edit code, verify), Qwen3-8B falls apart. It hallucinates rather than doing the work.

This is the real challenge for mesh-llm as an agent backend. The models can reason but they can't reliably execute multi-step tool-use workflows. MoM doesn't help here — you can't vote on "which model correctly edited a file" if none of them did.

**Next:** Test with MiniMax-253B (much stronger) and Qwen2.5-72B via the mesh to see if model scale closes the gap.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Try single-round MoM (parallel generate → vote → best answer) — same quality gain, 1/3 the latency
- [ ] Run same code review through MoM ensemble, compare with Claude
- [ ] Test with harder problems where models genuinely disagree
- [ ] Consider MoM as a mesh-llm router strategy for `model=auto`
